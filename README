This is a nice starter for making games in C with software rendering techniques
It uses SDL2 to handle inputs, and create a window texture that lets you manipulate the pixels of the window, without worrying about different display pixel formats
This is great for people who want to make software rendering style programs such as raycasters and doom / build engine style games, using pretty much the same techniques that they used back then, but with the modern advantages of compatibility

If you do make a project with this, I would love to see it!
